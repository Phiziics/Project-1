# Project-1  DATE: January 31, 2024
Simple Python data analysis
In this project, we will work with data from the entertainment industry. We will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos* and is still ongoing.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes.
